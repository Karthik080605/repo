                The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications made of stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials, generally built along an east-to-west line across the historical northern borders of China to protect the Chinese states and empires against the raids and invasions of the various nomadic groups of the Eurasian Steppe.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg">
                Several walls were being built as early as the 7th century BC; these, later joined together and made bigger and stronger, are now collectively referred to as the Great Wall. Especially famous is the wall built between 220–206 BC by the first Emperor of China, Qin Shi Huang. Little of that wall remains. The majority of the existing wall was built during the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644).

                The Great Wall is not a single continuous wall but a collection of walls and fortifications. The wall is built from a variety of materials, including stone, brick, tamped earth, and wood. The design of the wall varies depending on the terrain it traverses, with some sections featuring watchtowers, barracks, and other defensive structures.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg">
                The wall's construction was a massive undertaking, requiring the labor of hundreds of thousands of workers. The wall's height and width vary, with some sections reaching up to 30 feet high and 15 feet wide. The wall also features numerous watchtowers and fortresses, which were used to house troops and store supplies.

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-4">Distance from India to China</h2>
            <p class="text-lg mb-4">
                The distance between India and China varies depending on the specific locations being measured. For instance, the distance from New Delhi, India to Beijing, China is approximately 3,800 kilometers (2,361 miles) by air. The Great Wall of China is located in northern China, and the distance from New Delhi to the nearest section of the Great Wall is roughly 4,000 kilometers (2,485 miles).
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg">
                Traveling from India to China can be done by air, which is the most common and fastest method. There are also overland routes, but these are much longer and more complex due to the terrain and border crossings.
