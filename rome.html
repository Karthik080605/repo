     History
    </h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
     The Colosseum, also known as the Flavian Amphitheatre, is an ancient amphitheatre in the centre of Rome, Italy. It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world today, despite its age. Construction began under the emperor Vespasian in AD 72, and was completed in AD 80 under his successor and heir, Titus.

     Architecture
    </h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
     The Colosseum is an elliptical structure made of stone, concrete, and tuff. It measures 189 meters long, 156 meters wide, and stands 48 meters tall. The outer wall is estimated to have required over 100,000 cubic meters of travertine stone, which were set without mortar and held together by 300 tons of iron clamps. The Colosseum could hold between 50,000 and 80,000 spectators, and was used for gladiatorial contests and public spectacles such as animal hunts, executions, re-enactments of famous battles, and dramas based on Classical mythology.
